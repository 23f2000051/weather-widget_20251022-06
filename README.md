# Weather Widget

## Summary
This project is a simple weather widget that displays current weather information and a 5-day forecast for San Francisco, CA.

## Setup
To set up the project, simply clone the repository or download the files. Ensure that `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and `weather_data.json` are all in the same directory.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the weather widget. The page will dynamically fetch weather data from `weather_data.json` and display it in a user-friendly format.

## Code Explanation
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML markup for the widget, including a card-based layout with placeholders for weather information.
- **style.css**: Provides the styling for the layout, including responsive design features and hover effects.
- **script.js**: Handles fetching and displaying weather data from the JSON file, adds dynamic content, and manages error handling gracefully.
